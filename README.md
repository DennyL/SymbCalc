# SymbCalc
SymbCalc calculates frequency of character's presence in a text given, displays the most frequent characters and quantity of their presence in the text.
Written on Python 3.x.
Language of interface - Russian.

Beta 2:
1. Calculation of letters is now independent on register. From this time on it considers "A" and "a" as one letter.
2. Calculates both cyrilic and latin letters.
3. The programm neglets punctuation marks, numbers and smiles if they are in the text. If text consints thoroughly from symbols of that kind, programm informs there are no letters in the text given.

Beta 3:
Overall improvements. Last version that uses input() as the way of text input.
