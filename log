Beta 2:
1. Calculation of letters is now independent on register. From this time on it considers "A" and "a" as one letter.
2. Calculates both cyrilic and latin letters.
3. The programm neglets punctuation marks, numbers and smiles if they are in the text. If text consints thoroughly from symbols of that kind, programm informs there are no letters in the text given.

Beta 3:
Overall improvements. Last version that uses input() as the way of text input.

Beta 4:
1. Now the app is able to analyze a multiple line text.
It was achived by replacement of input() with sys.stdin.read()

Beta 5:
No square brackets in the output anymore. Now it is a nice and smart string.
SymbCalc now authomaticaly prints a proper ending in the output ("раз"/"раза")
which makes output more "human-like":)
